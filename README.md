## Why

One way for the country to escape for her current economic woes is to strengthen the Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). This is effort is not only for the government, it would take a joint effort from all stakeholders to pull the country to her feet. This app is one of such efforts to strengthen a sector in the nation - agricultural sector. If an effective system can be put up to make millions of Nigerians patronize thousands of stores in China from the comfort of their homes, then millions of Nigerians can patronize millions of fellow Nigerians from the comfort of their homes at reduced prices since middle men have been cut from the chain. This is the drive behind this application.

Focusing on the Agricultural sector is our own way of targeting three Sustainable Development Goals at once - No poverty, Zero hunger and Decent work/Economic growth. 

## Usage
Users would register on the application under three different categories - Farmers, Customers and Transporters. Customers can browse the market section to views Farmers, their products and prices. After making purchase, the customer can then link up with an transporter of choice to deliver the products purchased.


## Setup

Run `composer install` and `composer dump-autoload` to get started.

`index.php` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

All tests should be written in the test folder.

#### Hints

## Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
